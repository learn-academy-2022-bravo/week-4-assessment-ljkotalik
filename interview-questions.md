# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props stands for properties and allows us to access info in React.

  Researched answer: Props are how we access pieces of React state from other components.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: when there is change on a page

  Researched answer: This is how the dev implements change on a webpage by using javascript. An example would be When a user clicks the mouse, when a web page has loaded, etc. In order for the code to be excuted for when a user clicks on something the dev needs to add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP uses objects to store data whereas functional programming uses functions.

  Researched answer: Functional programming doesn't store data in objects. In OOP, we store data in objects and instances of those objects.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: an integer is a whole number and a Float is a number with a decimal

  Researched answer: my answer was correct anddd technically decimal is spearate from a flaot. The difference wouyld be that you would typically use float as it takes up less space, but the decimal is more accurate.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: it means you don't need to use the keyword return, it will automatically do that

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: When looking this up it seems that there were multiple definitions depending on which language you are referring to. Since we are on Ruby and will be on Ruby on Rails, I decided to go with that definition. Here is what I found:  An instance variable is a variable that is not inside of constructors, methods, or blocks. You can create an instance variable when you instantiate an object, and are accessible to all the constructors, methods, or blocks in the class.  

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system that is a more advanced version of SQL, which is a database managing system.

3. Ruby on Rails: is an open-sourced web application framework that was written in the Ruby language. It has 2 philosophies: DRY and Convention over Configuration, which means that ROR will suggest doing things in a specific way that ROR thinks will work best. It was designed to make designing web apps easier by making assumptions about what the dev needs to do, allows devs to write less code and makes it more fun.

4. ORM: ORM stands for Object-Relational-Mapping will allow you to be able to write queries in an easier way. The purpose is to interact with our database using the language of our choosing instead of using SQL.

5. Active Record: is the model in the model view controller. It's purpose is to represent business data and logic.
